# Collatz-Cruncher
A program to test billions of numbers in an effort to find a number that disproves the Collatz Conjecture.

## Installing
`git clone https://github.com/pythoncoder8888/Collatz-Cruncher.git`

## Running
`python3 CollatzCruncher.py`


## NOTE: Performance Fix
If your computer crashes, the program is killed, or becomes unresponsive, or you run out of RAM:
-  Change `power` variable in CollatzCruncher.py to something smaller (determines the amount of numbers that will be calculated at once)
-  Change `cooldown` variable in CollatzCruncher.py to something larger (determines the amount of time between calculating sets of numbers)
